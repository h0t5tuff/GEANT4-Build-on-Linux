# GEANT4-Build-on-Linux
In this guide, I walk through building Geant4 from source on a Linux system with full X11 and Qt support. It includes prerequisite package installation, common pitfalls during configuration, and how I resolved them. After this build, OpenGL visualization, Qt GUIs, and GDML parsing work correctly with multithreading enabled.
